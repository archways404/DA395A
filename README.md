## Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a movie recommendation system where users can select their favorite movies, and through our API, the system will recommend additional movies based on their selections. It uses data from The Movie Database (TMDb) API to fetch movies and genres.

## Features

- **Genre Selection:** Users can select their favorite movies from a list of genres.

- **Movie Selection:** Users can browse through a selection of movies and select their favorites.

- **Recommendation Algorithm:** The system uses an algorithm to recommend additional movies based on user selections and genre preferences.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js

- **Frontend:** React.js

- **API:** The Movie Database (TMDb) API

    touch .env
    ```

    ```
    // In the .env file:
    API_KEY=[YOUR_API_KEY]
